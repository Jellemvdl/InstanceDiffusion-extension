This blog post delves into, replicates, and builds upon the discoveries outlined in the CVPR 2024 paper titled "InstanceDiffusion: Instance-level Control for Image Generation."["InstanceDiffusion: Instance-level Control for Image Generation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03290) by Wang et al. (2024). Introducing InstanceDiffusion, the paper presents a technique that enhances text-to-image diffusion models by providing precise instance-level control, accommodating various language conditions and adaptable instance location specifications. The authors highlight InstanceDiffusion's superiority over specialized state-of-the-art models, demonstrating notable performance enhancements.

This purpose of this blog is to:
1. Help other researchers understand the InstanceDiffusion model. 
2. Verify the authors' claims by reproducing the results from the paper. 
3. Provide an extension to the original model.
