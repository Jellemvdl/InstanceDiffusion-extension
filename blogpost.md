In this blogpost we describe the paper of ["InstanceDiffusion: Instance-level Control for Image Generation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03290) by Wang et al. (2024), explain our reproduction of the work and our added extension. 
The paper introduces the method of InstanceDiffusion that adds precise instance-level control to text-to-image diffusion models.

This purpose of this blog is to:
1. Help other researchers understand the InstanceDiffusion model. 
2. Verify the authors' claims by reproducing the results from the paper. 
3. Provide an extension to the original model.
